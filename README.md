Description of the FDU/SHUTCM Tongue image Dataset:
We have collected 5600 tongue images in JPG image format, and most of them are taken by people who have not received professional guidance in a random environment.
We manually labeled them with Photoshop quick selection.
Images in our dataset are with large structure variation for both foreground and background regions.
