# FDU-TCMSU (FDU/SHUTCM Tongue Image Dataset)

We have collected 5600 tongue images in JPG image format, and most of them are taken by people who have not received professional guidance in a random environment. We manually labeled them with Photoshop quick selection.
Images in our dataset are with large structure variation for both foreground and background regions.
