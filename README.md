# FDU-TCMSU (FDU/SHUTCM Tongue Image Dataset)

We have collected 5600 tongue images in JPG image format, and most of them are taken by people who have not received professional guidance in a random environment. We manually labeled them with Photoshop quick selection.
Images in our dataset are with large structure variation for both foreground and background regions.

# Terms & Conditions
The dataset is available for non-commercial research purposes only.

You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade, resell or exploit for any commercial purposes, any portion of the images and any portion of derived data.
